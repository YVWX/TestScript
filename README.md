# TestScript

1stTest.py is to test Dinitz's algorithm of Networkx. Thanks to [fuglede](https://github.com/fuglede)'s work in [this thread](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/10566): the test scipt is heavily based on it.

2ndTest.py is another Dinitz' algorithm test based on networkx (test files)[https://github.com/networkx/networkx/tree/main/networkx/algorithms/flow/tests]. The test files are modified to time the maximum flow algorithms.
